# Projects
Fortunately, most of my projects are in client-companies with a very secretive treatment of their intellectual property and hence private code. Still, I find it fun to try out a couple things in here.

If I would do it all again... I would have forced a no-jupyter-notebooks rule from the beginning. Still, this samples created the value they needed when they needed it, and that's a really important business lesson.

1. **thewebsiteofdaniel**
   - Description: My personal website, written in HTML/Javascript/CSS, and published to [danielruiz.nl](https://danielruiz.nl). You may read about my experience and a couple cool things I've done. It's an alternative to my [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/econometrics) page.
   - Stack: HTML, Javascript, CSS, Front-End, GitHub (Pages), Domain & Hosting (Strato).
   - Impact: Designed, Written, and Deployed a website to the internet.

2. **interesting**
   - Description: The interesting Python package is a specialized toolkit for dealing with Brazilian fixed income titles. It provides functionalities to build, analyze, visualize, and valuate various types of fixed income instruments and portfolios made thereof.
   - Stack: Python, Pydantic, PyPi, PDM, Pre-Commit, Ruff, PyTest, GitHub (Actions, Codespace, Release), ChatGPT.
   - Knowledge domain: Corporate Finance, Interest Rates, Valuation, Portfolio Theory, Brazilian Financial Markets.
   - Impact: Wrote and published a library that may be installed anywhere in the world via 'pip install'.

3. **Retirement in Italy**
   - Description: This repo contains code to visualize the population in each Italian municipality in South Italy. The scope of this project is identifying the municipalities that offer financial incentives to move in at retirement age.
   - Stack: Python, Streamlit, GeoPandas, HTML.
   - Knowledge domain: Financial Planning, Maps, Italian Language, Front-End.
   - Impact: Enable efficient decision-making on selecting a nice Italian city to retire.

4. **pipelines**
   - Description: A central repo for the pipelines I use in my projects. It includes pre-commit (linting & formating) and testing for CI, and PyPi publishd for CD. It guarantees standardization, and eases setup and file management in project-repos.
   - Stack: Python, Pre-Commit, Ruff, PyTest, GitHub (Actions), CICD.
   - Impact: Implemented a repo with reusable pipelines that ease management and operations of pipelines.

5. **msc-thesis-nlp-twitter**
   - Description: An E2E project to capture data from TwitterAPI, perform noisy-label sentiment analysis, and model time-series and neural-network into it.
   - Stack: Python, TwitterAPI, Jupyter, Remote Computing.
   - Knowledge domain: Corporate Finance, Statistics, Econometrics (Regression, Time-Series), Machine Learning (Classification), Neural Networks (CNN), and NLP (Sentiment Analysis).
   - Impact: Approved with maximum grade at Bocconi University, qualifying for MSc Title in Data Science and Business Analytics.

6. **fx-tracker**
   - Description: The repo mines FX data (exchange rates), and then decomposes it into real exchange rates time-series. This decomposition hints if a currency is historically 'cheap' or 'expensive'.
   - Knowledge domain: Economics (International Economics, Macroeconomics), Finance (International Finance, Interest Rates, Exchange Rates).
   - Impact: Generated useful visualizations for informed decisions of buying and selling operations in FX markets.

# Tutorials
I also have a few repos that demonstrate a Python & Data Science concepts. They might help your learning too.

1. **tutorials**
   - Description: CNN, NN, regressions, classifiers, time-series.

2. **covid-excess-deaths-italy**
   - Description: A few custom graphs on the excess mortality in Italy during the first wave of COVID.

3. **multi-class-classification**
   - Description: Multi-Class classification problems.

4. **python-exercises**
   - Description: A collection of coursera and textbook exercises to learn basic concepts of Python.
